We were the first international online retailer for buying and trading new and used outdoor gear with a focus on hunting bows. I was tasked with designing the website from the ground up.

                            <p class="paragraph">

                                I conducted extensive research, through customer interviews, reviews, articles, and product videos, in order to determine the best approach for creating a functional website that fulfills the needs of its target demographic. With this information, I designed a sleek and practical website that effectively serves the user.
                                In Axure, I put together wireframes and detailed <b>mockups to communicate my vision to a cross-functional team of designers and developers</b>. My goal was to create a look for the website that clearly conveyed its purpose, to sell outdoor sporting gear, through the design alone. I accomplished this by choosing a color scheme and iconography that evokes an autumnal woodsy atmosphere.

For instance, while analyzing the heatmaps and watching users navigate the page, I noticed that people were not using the drop down menu to explore the available products. In response, we changed the menus so that all options were displayed at the top level.</p>
